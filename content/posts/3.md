So i've been thinking, since i disconnected from most social networks i can't seem to understand the new memes.

So that got me thinking about this of this weird series called Skibidi Toilet. We all laugh at people who like it because it doesn't make sense at all.

But in reality is not any different to the Youtube Poops or MLG edits and the gmod animations. They are the same in essence.

I usually talk with people around my age, so no one watches or likes this weird series. We all make fun of it.

I remember when people made fun of me for playing Minecraft or videogames in general. Are we doing the same? Why don't we let kids be kids? To get obsessed with senseless shit. Is nostalgia blurring our judgement?

If we expect them to only play or see *the right thing* we are striping them of their freedom of choice.

And some of you may say, this whole post doesn't matter at all. But i think it does, if we don't stop the patterns we act upon, who will?
