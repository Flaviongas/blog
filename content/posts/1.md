Is not that i don't like AI, i love the concept and the works of fiction created around it, i love the math and effort that went into creating.

It's a marvel of technology, something never seen before.

But when people start creating stuff with it: Art, Poems, Stories and Code, it doesn't seem moral. It's like you're stripping the effort and the meaning out of the product. For me the value of things it's the effort that you put into it, not the finished result.

I think that when you start using these AIs, you become dependent, you stop looking for solutions and get used to asking it stuff.

But here is the real issue, it does give good results. I have spent soooo much time into my projects, and yeah they're good, i'm proud of them, but i would have done them faster using ai.

A professor told me:
> "People using ai have an advantage"

and he's right, you DO get stuff done faster, and you still have to do some kind of work.

But it doesn't feel right. Am i too much of an idealist? I want to do stuff manually, otherwise how would i learn?

Is there some kind of compromise? A point where i still put effort and get stuff done quickly at the same time?

I can do so much stuff without ai, good quality pages and presentations. If i were to use ai to help me, i could do so much more, right?

I'm not totally closed to the idea, but i have to think it more.
