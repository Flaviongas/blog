        <h1>On spirituality and philosophy</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content__body">
        <p>I have found that a lot of people think that philosophy and spirituality are closely related. But they are not.</p>
<p>Philosophy aims to answer any question that can not be answered, and from which the more important ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the meaning of life?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What happens after we die?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of people answer these questions with their religion, their belief gives meaning to all of the human experience.</p>
<p>Some people don&rsquo;t really believe in any religion but are spiritual nonetheless, and they try to answer these questions by other means.</p>
<p>Tarot, Zodiac, Arcana, Wicca are all examples of the same thing: To give life and the chaos inherent to it some order, some sense.</p>
<p>And yeah, philosophy tries to do the same. But philosophy has many areas for reasoning about it: Realism, Rationalism, Empirism, Metaphysics, etc.</p>
<p>But the main objetive of Philosophy is to try to answer any questions and challenge the answers, not just to give life meaning.</p>
<p>All the esoteric cults try to explain the world by injecting some magic into it, some piece of information or knowledge that only a specific group of people have access to.</p>
<p>Most of philosophy tries to give meaning to life just by the use of logic and reason, not by magic. Spirituality doesn&rsquo;t have anything to do with the act of philosophising.</p>
<p>And i understand the confusion, it just so happens that both try to give an answer to the same question. But the approach is completely different.</p>
<p>They are not the same.</p>
